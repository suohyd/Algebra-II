<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof">If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is irreducible then we are done. So, assume that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is reducible. Let <span class="process-math">\(f=f_1f_2\)</span> be a factorization of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and neither <span class="process-math">\(f_i\)</span> is a constant polynomial. If both <span class="process-math">\(f_i\)</span> are irreducible polynomials we are done. Now assume that one of the polynomials, say <span class="process-math">\(f_1\)</span> is reducible. So, there are <span class="process-math">\(f_{1i}\in F[X]\text{,}\)</span> not both constant, such that <span class="process-math">\(f_1=f_{11}f_{12}\text{.}\)</span> Say <span class="process-math">\(f_{11}\)</span> is reducible. Then we continue the process. We claim that this process will eventually terminate. Suppose not. Then we get the following infinite chain of ideals:<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
I_0=(f)\subsetneq I_1=(f_1)\subsetneq I_2=(f_{11})\subsetneq\cdots\subsetneq F[X]
\end{equation*}
</div>Since <span class="process-math">\(f_2\)</span> is not a constant polynomial the first inclusion is strict. Similar reasoning implies that all inclusion are strict. Consider the ideal <span class="process-math">\(I=\cup_{i=0}^{\infty} I_i\text{.}\)</span> Since every ideal of <span class="process-math">\(F[X]\)</span> is generated by a single element, there is <span class="process-math">\(g\in F[X]\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\((g)=I\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, there is <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g\in I_n\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\((g)=I\subseteq I_n\subseteq I\text{,}\)</span> i.e., <span class="process-math">\(I_n=I_{k}\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(k\geq n\text{.}\)</span> Thus this shows that every non-constant polynomial is a product of irreducible factors. Now assume that<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f=p_1p_2\cdots p_n=q_1q_2\cdots q_m\quad\text{with}\;n\leq m
\end{equation*}
</div>Since <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> is irreducible it divides <span class="process-math">\(q_i\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> By renumbering we assume that <span class="process-math">\(p_1\)</span> divides <span class="process-math">\(q_1\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> is irreducible there is <span class="process-math">\(u_1\in F^\times\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(u_1p_1=q_1\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, we have the following.<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f=p_1p_2\cdots p_n=u_1p_1q_2\cdots q_m
\end{equation*}
</div>Thus <span class="process-math">\(p_1(p_2\cdots p_n-u_1q_2\cdots q_m)=0\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, as <span class="process-math">\(F[X]\)</span> is an integral domain, <span class="process-math">\(p_2p_3\cdots p_n=q_2q_3\cdots q_m\text{.}\)</span> We repeat the above argument to get <span class="process-math">\(1=u_1u_2\cdots u_nq_{n+1}\cdots q_m\text{,}\)</span> i.e., <span class="process-math">\(q_{n+1},\ldots,q_m\)</span> are units in <span class="process-math">\(F[X]\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(q_{n+1},\ldots,q_m\)</span> are constant polynomials. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(m=n\)</span> and the last statement of the theorem is proved.</article></body>
