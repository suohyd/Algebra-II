		<statement>
			Let <m>F</m> be a field. The set of polynomials in <m>n</m> variables over <m>F</m> is <md><mrow>F[X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n]\amp=\bigg\{\sum a_{i_1\cdots i_r}X^{i_1}X^{i_2}\cdots X^{i_r}:i_j\in\N\cup\{0\},</mrow><mrow>\amp\quad\qquad\qquad a_{i_1\cdots i_r}\in F\text{ and all but finitely many }a_{i_1\cdots i_r}= 0\bigg\}</mrow></md>
			<p>
				The set <m>F[X_1,\ldots,X_n]</m> is defined inductively. When <m>n=1</m> it is a polynomial ring. Suppose we have defined <m>R=F[X_1,\ldots,X_{n-1}]</m>. Then <m>F[X_1,\ldots,X_n]=R[X_n]</m>. Show that it is a ring, in fact, an integral domain. Further show that <m>F[X_1,\ldots,X_n]</m> is an <m>F</m>-algebra.

		<statement>
		Let <m>R</m> be a ring. Show that if <m>0\neq r\in R</m> has no left inverse but has a right inverse then <m>r</m> has infinitely many right inverses.
	<p>We show that if <m>n>0</m> then <m>r</m> has at least <m>n+1</m> right inverses.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Assume that there exists <m>n>0</m> such that <m>s_k</m> is a right inverse of <m>r</m> for <m>0\leq k\leq n</m>, and <m>s_k\neq s_\ell</m> for <m>k\neq\ell</m>.
			</li> 
			<li>
				For each <m>k\in\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}</m> we put 
			<me>t_k=s_0+1-s_kr.</me>
			Show that <m>rt_k=1</m>, i.e., each <m>t_k</m> is a right inverse of <m>r</m>.
		</li>
			<li>
				Show that <m>t_k\neq t_\ell</m> for <m>k\neq\ell</m> and <m>k,\ell\in\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}</m>.
