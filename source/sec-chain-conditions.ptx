	<title>(Principal ideal domain)</title>
	<statement>
		An integral domain in which every ideal is principal, i.e., every ideal can be generated by an element, is said to be a <term>principal ideal domain</term>.
	</statement>
</definition>
<convention>
	<statement>
		We abbreviate a principal ideal domain by PID.
	</statement>
</convention>
<theorem>
	<statement>
		Every PID satisfy the ascending chain condition.
	</statement>
</theorem>
<proof>
	Let <m>A</m> be a PID and let <m>\mfa_1\subseteq\mfa_2\subseteq\cdots</m> be an ascending chain of ideals in <m>A</m>. Thus, <m>\mfa=\bigcup_i\mfa_i</m> is an ideal of <m>A</m>. Suppose that <m>\mfa_i=(a_i)</m> for each <m>i</m>. Since <m>A</m> is PID, there exists <m>a\in\mfa</m> such that <m>\mfa=(a)</m>. Suppose that <m>a\in\mfa_n</m>. We claim that <m>\mfa_n=\mfa_i</m> for all <m>i\geq n</m>. Indeed, since <m>(a)=\bigcup_i\mfa_i</m> we have <m>\mfa_i\subseteq(a)</m>. Conversely, as <m>a\in\mfa_n\subseteq\mfa_i</m> for every <m>i\geq n</m>, the ideal generated by <m>a</m>, <m>(a)\subseteq\mfa_i</m> for every <m>i\geq n</m>.
</proof>
<lemma xml:id="irreducible-implies-maximal-PID">
	<statement>
		An ideal generated by an irreducible element in a PID is maximal.
	</statement>
</lemma>
<proof>
	Let <m>A</m> be a PID and let <m>p\in A</m> be an irreducible. Suppose that <m>I</m> is an ideal containing <m>(p)</m>. Since <m>A</m> is PID there exists <m>a\in I</m> such that <m>I=(a)</m>. Hence <m>a\mid p</m>. Since <m>p</m> is irreducible either <m>a\sim p</m> or <m>a</m> is a unit. In other words, either <m>(p)=(a)</m> or <m>(a)=A</m>.
</proof>
<p>
	By <xref ref="maximal-implies-prime"/>, an ideal generated by an irreducible element in a PID will be a prime ideal. Thus we get the following.

<theorem xml:id="irreducible-implies-prime-PID">
<statement>
	In a PID every irreducible element is a prime element.
</statement>
</theorem>
<theorem xml:id="PID-implies-UFD">
	<statement>Every PID is UFD.</statement>
</theorem>
<example xml:id="UFD-but-not-PID">
	<title>(UFD but not a PID)</title>
	<statement>
		Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>F[x,y]</m> be the polynomial ring over <m>F</m> in two variables. Note that <m>F[x,y]=F[x][y]</m> hence it is UFD (we prove this result in <xref ref="polynomial-ring-over-field-is-UFD"/>). We show that the ideal generated by <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, <m>(x,y)</m> is not principal. Suppose that <m>f\in F[x,y]</m> is such that <m>(x,y)=(f)</m>. By <xref ref="division-algorithm-for-LC-unit"/>,
		<me>x=q_1f\quad\text{and}\quad y=q_2f\quad\text{for}\;q_i\in F[x,y].</me>
		Note that <m>x</m> considered as an element in the polynomial ring over F[x] in the variable <m>y</m> is a constant polynomial. Thus, <m>f</m> when viewed as a polynomial over <m>F[x]</m> in the variable <m>y</m> must have degree zero. Similarly the degree of <m>f</m> as a polynomial in <m>F[y][x]</m> is zero. Hence <m>f\in F</m> and thus <m>(x,y)=F[x,y]</m>. However, <m>x+1\not\in (x,y)</m>. Therefore, <m>(x,y)</m> is not a principal ideal.
