	<title>Arithmetic in <m>\Z</m></title>
	<introduction>Recall that every ideal in <m>\Z</m> is generated by a single integer, i.e., every ideal in <m>\Z</m> is principal (see <xref ref="ideals-of-Z"/>). For <m>a\in\Z</m> it is easy to see that <m>a\Z=(-a)\Z</m>. We use this fact without explicitly mentioning it.</introduction>
	<lemma xml:id="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z">
		<title>(Divisibility and containment of ideals in <m>\Z</m>)</title>
		<statement>
			Let <m>m,n\in\N</m>. Let <m>m\Z</m> ideal generated by <m>m</m>, and <m>n\Z</m> ideal generated by <m>n</m>. Then we show the following
			<ol><li> <m>n\mid m</m>, i.e., <m>n</m> divides <m>m</m> if and only if <m>m\Z\subseteq n\Z</m>.</li>
			<li>
				If <m>\ell=lcm(m,n)</m> then <m>m\Z\cap n\Z=\ell\Z</m>.
			</li>
			<li>If <m>d=\gcd(m,n)</m> then <m>m\Z+n\Z=d\Z</m>.
		</li>
		</ol>
		</statement>
	</lemma>
	<proof>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Suppose that <m>n\mid m</m>, i.e., there exists <m>k\in\Z</m> such that <m>m=nk</m>. Hence, <m>m\in n\Z</m> and therefore any multiple of <m>m</m> is also in the ideal <m>n\Z</m>. Thus <m>m\Z\subseteq n\Z</m>.
			Conversely, if <m>m\Z\subseteq n\Z</m> then there exists <m>\ell\in\Z</m> such that <m>m=n\ell</m>, i.e., <m>n</m> divides <m>m</m>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Since every ideal of <m>\Z</m> is principal and the intersection of ideals is an ideal, there exists <m>e\in\N</m> such that <m>m\Z\cap n\Z=e\Z</m>. In particular, <m>e\Z\subseteq m\Z</m> and <m>e\Z\subseteq n\Z</m>. By <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>(1), we have <m>m\mid e</m> and <m>n\mid e</m>. Therefore, <m>\ell\mid e</m> and hence <m>e\Z=m\Z\cap n\Z\subseteq \ell\Z</m>. Conversely, since <m>\ell=lcm(m,n)</m>, <m>m\mid \ell</m> and <m>n\mid \ell</m> we get that <m>\ell\Z\subseteq m\Z\cap n\Z</m>. We thus proved the result.
	</li>
	<li>
		This is left to the reader. Recall that <m>m\Z+n\Z</m> is the smallest ideal containing both <m>m\Z</m> and <m>n\Z</m>.

	<proposition xml:id="prime-number-implies-field-in-Z">
		<statement>
			Let <m>n\Z</m> be an ideal of <m>\Z</m>, where <m>n\in\N</m>. Then we have the following.
		<ol>
			<li>If <m>n</m> is not a prime number then <m>\Z/n\Z</m> is not an integral domain.</li>
			<li>
				The ring <m>\Z/n\Z</m> is a field if and only if <m>n</m> is prime.
			</li>
			<li>
				The group of units of <m>\Z/n\Z</m>, <m>\left(\Z/n\Z\right)^\times=\{[i]\in\Z/n\Z:\gcd(i,n)=1\}.</m>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</statement>
	</proposition>
	<proof>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Suppose that <m>n</m> is not a prime. Thus there exists natural numbers <m>1\lt k\lt n</m> and <m>1\lt\ell\lt n</m> such that <m>n=k\ell</m>. Hence <m>[n]=[0]=[k][\ell]</m> where, <m>[k]\neq[0]</m> and <m>[\ell]\neq[0]</m>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Suppose that <m>n</m> is a prime number. For any <m>1\leq i\lt n</m>, <m>\gcd(i,n)=1</m> and hence <m>\Z=i\Z+n\Z</m> (see <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>(3)), i.e., there exists <m>x,y\in\Z</m> with <m>1=ix+ny</m>. Therefore, <m>[1]=[i][x]\in\Z/n\Z</m>, i.e., <m>[i]</m> is invertible. Converse follows from the part (1) of this proposition.
			</li>
			<li>
				Suppose that <m>[i]\in\Z/n\Z</m> is a unit, i.e., there exists a unique <m>[j]\in\Z/n\Z</m> such that <m>[i][j]=[1]</m>, i.e., <m>ij=1+nk</m> for some <m>k\in\Z</m>. If <m>d</m> is a (positive) divisor of both <m>i</m> and <m>n</m> then <m>d</m> must divide <m>1=ij-nk</m>. Hence <m>d=1</m>, i.e., <m>\gcd(i,n)=1</m>. Converse is left to the reader.

	<proposition xml:id="universal-property-of-Q">
		<title>(Universal property of the field of rational numbers)</title>
		<statement>
		 Consider  the canonical homomorphism <m>i_{\Z}\colon\Z\to\Q</m> (see <xref ref="initial-object-in-Rings"/>). Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>\varphi\colon\Z\to F</m> be a ring monomorphism. Then there is a unique ring monomorphism from <m>\widetilde{\varphi}\colon\Q\to F</m> such that <m>\varphi=\widetilde{\varphi}\circ i_{\Z}</m>.
		</statement>
	</proposition>
	<proof>
	For a nonzero element <m>r\in\Q</m> (resp., <m>\alpha\in F</m>) its inverse is denoted by <m>1/r</m> (resp., <m>1/\alpha\in F</m>). 
	For any <m>0\neq m\in\Z</m>, <m>\varphi(m)\neq 0\in F</m> because <m>\varphi</m> is a monomorphism of rings. We define <m>\widetilde{\varphi}</m> using <m>\varphi</m> as follows.
		<me>\widetilde{\varphi}\left(m/n\right)=\varphi(m)/\varphi(n).</me>
		It is left to the reader to check that <m>\widetilde{\varphi}</m> is  a well-defined ring monomorphism, and that <m>\widetilde{\varphi}\circ i_{\Z}=\varphi</m>.
		<p>
			We show the uniqueness. Suppose that <m>\psi\colon\Q\to F</m> be a ring monomorphism such that <m>\psi\circ i_{\Z}=\varphi</m>. Since <m>\psi</m> is a ring homomorphism we must have <me>\psi(1)=1\quad\text{and}\quad\psi(m)=\psi(\underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{m\text{-times}})=\underbrace{\psi(1)+\psi(1)+\cdots\psi(1)}_{m\text{-times}}=m.</me> Thus we get <m>\varphi(m)=\psi(m)=m</m>, for any <m>m\in\Z</m>. By ring homomorphism properties we have <m>\psi(m/n)=\psi(m)/\psi(n)=m/n=\varphi(m)/\varphi(n)</m>. Hence uniqueness is proved.

			Suppose that <m>p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_r</m> are distinct prime numbers. Let <m>a_1,\ldots,a_r</m> be natural numbers, and put <m>n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_r^{a_r}</m>. There is a ring isomorphism

		<ol>
			<li><title>[Well-definedness]</title>
			Suppose that <m>x+n\Z=y+n\Z</m>, i.e., <m>x-y\in n\Z</m>. Hence <m>x-y=nk</m> for some <m>k\in\Z</m>. For each <m>i</m> we therefore have <m>p_i^{a_i}\mid x-y</m> (see <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">Fundamental theorem of arithmetic</url>). Hence, for each <m>i</m>, <m>x+p_i^{a_i}=y+p_i^{a_i}</m> and thus <m>f</m> is well-defined.

			To check <m>f</m> is a ring homomorphism is left to the reader.

		<li>
			<title>[Injectivity]</title>
			Suppose that <m>f(x+n\Z)=0</m>, i.e., <m>x\in p_i^{a_i}\Z</m> for each <m>i</m>. In other words, <m>x\in\bigcap_{i=1}^{r}p_i^{a_i}\Z</m>. Since <m>lcm(p_1^{a_1},\ldots,p_r^{a_r})=n</m>, by <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>, we get that <m>x\in n\Z</m>. Hence <m>f</m> is injective.
		</li>
		<li>
			<title>[Surjectivity]</title>
			We only show that <m>(1+p_1^{a_1},0+p_2^{a_2},\ldots,0+p_r^{a_r})</m> is in the image of <m>f</m>. By <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>, we have <m>p_1^{a_1}+p_i^{a_i}=\Z</m> for any <m>1\lt i\leq r</m>. Therefore, for every <m>1\lt i\leq r</m>, there are <m>x_i\in p_1^{a_1}\Z</m> and <m>y_i\in p_i^{a_i}\Z</m> such that
			<me>x_i+y_i=1.</me> Put <m>y=y_2y_3\cdots y_r</m>. Then
			<me>y+p_1^{a_1}\Z=\prod_{i=2}^r (1-x_i)+p_1^{a_1}\Z=1+p_1^{a_1}\Z</me>
			and
			<me>y+p_i^{a_i}=0+p_i^{a_i}\Z\quad\text{for all}\quad i\in\{2,3,\ldots,r\}.</me>
			Hence <m>f(y)=(1+p_1^{a_1},0+p_2^{a_2},\ldots,0+p_r^{a_r})</m>.
		</li>
		</ol>
	</proof>
	<remark>
		<statement>
			Since the isomorphism given in <xref ref="Chinese-remainder-theorem-in-Z"/> is a ring homomorphism the group of units on both sides are also isomorphic. Thus
			<me>(\Z/n\Z)^\times\simeq(\Z/p_1^{a_1}\Z)^\times\times(\Z/p_2^{a_2}\Z)^\times\times\cdots\times(\Z/p_r^{a_r}\Z)^\times.</me>
