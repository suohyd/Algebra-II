	<proposition xml:id="existence-of-maximal-ideal">
		<title>(Existence of a maximal ideal)</title>
		<statement>
			Every nonzero commutative ring has a maximal ideal.
		</statement>
	</proposition>
	<proof>
		Let <m>A</m> be a nonzero commutative ring. Let <m>S</m> be a set of all proper ideals in <m>A</m>. Since <m>(0)\in S</m> the set <m>S\neq\emptyset</m>. We order <m>S</m> by inclusion. We will use Zorn's lemma<fn>Let <m>(S,\leq)</m> be a nonempty partially ordered set. A subset <m>T\subset S</m> is a chain of <m>S</m> if for any <m>x,y\in T</m> either <m>x\leq y</m> or <m>y\leq x</m>. The Zorn's lemma asserts that if every chain <m>T</m> of <m>S</m> has an upper bound in <m>S</m>, i.e., there exists <m>s\in S</m> such that for every <m>t\in T</m> we have <m>t\leq s</m>, then <m>S</m> has at least one maximal element. </fn>
		 to prove the statement. In that vein, let <m>(\mfa_i)_{i\in I}</m> be a chain of ideals in <m>S</m>, i.e., for any <m>i,j</m> either <m>\mfa_i\subseteq\mfa_j</m> or <m>\mfa_j\subseteq\mfa_i</m>. Then <m>\bigcup_i\mfa_i</m> is a proper ideal in <m>A</m> (verify!). Thus <m>\bigcup_i\mfa_i\in S</m>. We have shown that every chain in a nonempty set <m>S</m> has an upper bound in <m>S</m>. Hence, by Zorn's lemma, <m>S</m> has a maximal element.
	</proof>
	<p>
		More generally we have the following.
	</p>
	<proposition xml:id="existence-of-maximal-left-ideal">
		<title>(Existence of a maximal left ideal)</title>
		<statement>
			Let <m>R</m> be a ring and let <m>I</m> be a proper left ideal in <m>R</m>. Then there exists a maximal left ideal <m>\mfm</m> in <m>R</m> containing <m>I</m>.
		</statement>
	</proposition>

	<lemma xml:id="maximal-implies-prime">
		<statement>
			In a commutative ring every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.
		</statement>
	</lemma>
	<proof>
		Let <m>A</m> be a commutative ring and <m>\mfm</m> be a maximal ideal in <m>A</m>. Let <m>a,b\in A</m> be such that <m>ab\in\mfm</m>. Suppose that <m>a\not\in\mfm</m>. Then the ideal generated by <m>\mfm</m> and <m>a</m>, <m>(\mfm,a)</m> properly contains <m>\mfm</m>. Hence, <m>(\mfm,a)=A</m>. In particular, <m>1\in(\mfm,a)</m>, say <m>1=m+ax</m> for some <m>m\in\mfm</m> and <m>x\in A</m>. Hence, <m>b=b1=bm+bax\in(\mfm,a)</m>. Since <m>m,ba=ab\in\mfm</m> we get that <m>b\in\mfm</m>.
	</proof>
	<proposition xml:id="prime-maximal-criterion-using-quotient">
		<statement>
			Let <m>A</m> be a commutative ring. Then we have the following.
			<ol>
				<li>A proper ideal <m>\mfp</m> in <m>A</m> is a prime ideal if and only if <m>A/\mfp</m> is an integral domain</li>
				<li>A proper ideal <m>\mfm</m> in <m>A</m> is a maximal ideal if and only if <m>A/\mfm</m> is a field.</li>
			</ol>
		</statement>
	</proposition>
	<proof>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Let <m>\mfp</m> be a prime ideal, and let <m>a,b\in A</m> be such that <m>(a+\mfp)(b+\mfp)=0+\mfp</m>, i.e., <m>ab\equiv 0\mod\mfp</m>. Thus, <m>ab\in\mfp</m> and either <m>a\in\mfp</m> or <m>b\in\mfp</m> because <m>\mfp</m> is a prime ideal. Hence, <m>A/\mfp</m> is an integral domain. Conversely, assume that <m>A/\mfp</m> is an integral domain for a proper ideal <m>\mfp</m>. Let <m>ab\in\mfp</m>. Thus <m>ab\equiv 0\mod\mfp</m>. Since <m>A/\mfp</m> is an integral domain we have either <m>a\equiv 0\mod\mfp</m> or <m>b\equiv 0\mod\mfp</m>. Hence either <m>a\in\mfp</m> or <m>b\in\mfp</m>, i.e., <m>\mfp</m> is a prime ideal.
			</li>
			<li>
				Suppose that <m>A/\mfm</m> is a field. By <xref ref="ideal-correspondence-quotient-ring"/>, ideals of <m>A</m> containing <m>\mfm</m> are <m>\mfm</m> and <m>A</m>. Thus <m>\mfm</m> is a maximal ideal. Conversely, assume that <m>\mfm</m> is a maximal ideal. By <xref ref="maximal-implies-prime"/> and the first part of this theorem, <m>A/\mfm</m> is an integral domain. By <xref ref="ideal-correspondence-quotient-ring"/> only ideals of <m>A/\mfm</m> are the trivial ideal and the whole ring. Thus for any nonzero <m>x\in A/\mfm</m> the ideal generated by <m>x</m> is <m>A/\mfm</m>. Therefore, there exists <m>y\in A/\mfm</m> such that <m>xy=1\in A/\mfm</m>. Thus, <m>A/\mfm</m> is a field.
			</li>

	</proof>
	<p>
		In the following proposition we use criterion for prime/maximal ideal obtained in <xref ref="prime-maximal-criterion-using-quotient"/> without explicitly mentioning it.
	</p>
	<proposition>
		<statement>
			Let <m>A</m> be a commutative ring and let <m>\mfa</m> be an ideal in <m>A</m>. Then there is a one-one correspondence between prime ideals of <m>A</m> containing <m>\mfa</m> and prime ideals of <m>A/\mfa</m>.
			<me>\left\{\mfp:\mfp\text{ is a prime ideal containing }\mfa\right\}\longleftrightarrow{}\left\{\text{prime ideals in }A/\mfa\right\}\quad\text{It is defined by}\quad\mfp\mapsto\mfp/\mfa.</me>

			Similarly, there is a one-one correspondence between maximal ideals of <m>A</m> containing <m>\mfa</m> and maximal ideals of <m>A/\mfa</m>.
			<me>\left\{\mfm:\mfm\text{ is a maximal ideal containing }\mfa\right\}\longleftrightarrow{}\left\{\text{maximal ideals in }A/\mfa\right\}\quad\text{It is defined by}\quad\mfm\mapsto\mfm/\mfa.</me>
		</statement>
		<proof>
					<p>
						Let <m>\mfa\subseteq\mfp</m> be a prime ideal in <m>A</m>. Consider the ideal <m>\mfp/\mfa</m> in <m>A/\mfa</m>. By <xref ref="TIT"/>, <m>(A/\mfp)\simeq(A/\mfa)\big/(\mfp/\mfa)</m>. As <m>A/\mfp</m> is an integral domain, we have  <m>\mfp/\mfa</m> is a prime ideal. Conversely assume that <m>I</m> is a prime ideal in <m>A/\mfa</m>. Thus there exists an ideal <m>\mfp</m> in <m>A</m> such that <m>I=\mfp/\mfa</m> (see <xref ref="ideal-correspondence-quotient-ring"/>). By <xref ref="TIT"/>, <me>A/\mfp\simeq(A/\mfa)\big/(\mfp/\mfa)\simeq(A/\mfa)\big/ I.</me> Since <m>A/I</m> is an integral domain, <m>A/\mfp</m> is also an integral domain. Hence, <m>\mfp</m> is a prime ideal.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mapping <m>\mfp\mapsto\mfp/\mfa</m> is one-one follows from <xref ref="ideal-correspondence-quotient-ring"/>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The statement about maximal ideals follow by similar arguments as given above.
