		<title>(Prime ideal is generated by a prime number)</title>
		<statement>
			A nonzero ideal <m>\mfp</m> in <m>\Z</m> is a prime ideal if and only if <m>\mfp</m> is generated by a prime number.
		</statement>
	</theorem>
	<proof>
		<p>
			Suppose that <m>\mfp</m> is a nonzero prime ideal. By <xref ref="ideals-of-Z"/>, there exists <m>n\in\N</m> such that <m>\mfp=n\Z</m>. Let <m>k\in\N</m> be such that <m>k\mid n</m>, i.e., there exists <m>\ell\in\Z</m> such that <m>n=k\ell</m>. Since <m>\mfp=n\Z</m> is a prime ideal, and <m>n=k\ell\in\mfp</m>, either <m>k\in\mfp</m> or <m>\ell\in\mfp</m> (see <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>). Thus either <m>n\mid k</m> or <m>n\mid\ell</m>. If <m>n\mid k</m> then we get <m>k=n</m> because, by our assumption, <m>k\mid n</m>. If <m>n\mid\ell</m>, say <m>\ell=ns</m> for some <m>s\in\Z</m>, then <m>n=kns</m>, i.e., <m>n(1-ks)=0\in\Z</m>. As <m>\Z</m> is an integral domain, <m>ks=1</m> and hence <m>k=1</m>. Thus a divisor of <m>n</m> is either <m>n</m> or <m>1</m>, i.e., <m>n</m> is a prime number.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conversely let <m>p</m> be a prime number and consider the ideal generated by <m>p</m>, <m>p\Z</m>. We show that <m>p\Z</m> is a prime ideal. Let <m>a,b\in\Z</m> be such that <m>ab\in p\Z</m>, i.e., <m>p\mid ab</m> (see <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>). As <m>p</m> is a prime number either <m>p\mid a</m> or <m>p\mid b</m>. By <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/> either <m>a\in p\Z</m> or <m>b\in p\Z</m>.
		</p>
	</proof>
	<remark>
		<statement>
			In view of the above result it is clear that there are infinitely many prime ideals in <m>\Z</m>.

	<p>
		As a consequence of <xref ref="prime-ideal-generated-by-prime-in-Z"/> we obtain the following result.

	<theorem xml:id="every-prime-is-maximal-in-Z">
		<title>(A nonzero prime ideal if and only if maximal)</title>
		<statement>
			A nonzero ideal <m>\mfp</m> in <m>\Z</m> is a prime ideal if and only if <m>\mfp</m> is a maximal ideal.
		</statement>
	</theorem>
	<proof>
		This follows from <xref ref="prime-ideal-generated-by-prime-in-Z"/> and <xref ref="prime-number-implies-field-in-Z"/>.
		<p>
			Suppose that <m>\mfp</m> is a nonzero prime ideal. By <xref ref="prime-ideal-generated-by-prime-in-Z"/>, <m>\mfp</m> is generated by a prime number. By <xref ref="prime-number-implies-field-in-Z"/>, <m>\Z/\mfp</m> is a field. If <m>\mfa</m> is an ideal containing <m>\mfp</m> then <m>\mfa+\mfp</m> is an ideal of <m>\Z/\mfp</m> (see <xref ref="ideal-correspondence-quotient-ring"/>). By <xref ref="ideals-of-division-rings"/> only ideals of fields are the trivial ideal and the whole field we must have either <m>\mfa=\mfp</m> or <m>\mfa=\Z</m>. Hence <m>\mfp</m> is a maximal ideal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose that <m>\mfm</m> is a maximal ideal, say generated by <m>a</m>, i.e., <m>\mfm=a\Z</m>. Let <m>b\in\N</m> be a divisor of <m>a</m>, i.e., <m>b\mid a</m>. By <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>, <m>\mfm=a\Z\subseteq b\Z</m>. As <m>\mfm</m> is maximal either <m>\mfm=b\Z</m> or <m>b\Z=\Z</m>, i.e., either <m>a=b</m> or <m>b=1</m> (see <xref ref="Divisibility-ideals-in-Z"/>). Hence <m>a</m> must be a prime number. By <xref ref="prime-ideal-generated-by-prime-in-Z"/>, <m>\mfm</m> is a prime ideal.
		</p>
	</proof>
	<remark>
		<statement>
			In a commutative ring, a maximal ideal is always a prime ideal. However, a prime ideal may not be a maximal ideal, in general.
