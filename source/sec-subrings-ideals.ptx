	<title>Subrings and Ideals</title>
	<introduction>
		In this section we define notions and terminology related to subrings and ideals of a ring. In the next section we give several examples related to these notions.

	<definition xml:id="def-subring">
		<title>(Subring)</title>
		<statement>
			A subset <m>S</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is said to be a <term>subring of <m>R</m></term> if it satisfy the following conditions.
			<ol>
				<li>The addition inherited from <m>R</m> makes <m>S</m> a subgroup of <m>(R,+)</m>.</li>
				<li>The unity <m>1</m> of <m>R</m> belongs to <m>S</m>.</li>
				<li><m>S</m> is closed under multiplication inherited from <m>R</m>, i.e., for any <m>s,t\in S\subseteq R</m> we have <m>st\in S</m>.</li>
			</ol>
		</statement>
	</definition>
	<remark>
		<statement>
			A subring <m>S</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is itself is a ring with unity. Furthermore, the unity of <m>S</m> is the same as the unity <m>R</m>.
		</statement>
	</remark>
	<lemma xml:id="intersection-of-subrings">
		<statement>
			Suppose that <m>S_i</m> (<m>i\in I</m>) are subrings of a ring <m>R</m>. The intersection of <m>S_i</m>, <m>\bigcap_iS_i</m> is a subring of <m>R</m>.
		</statement>
	</lemma>
	<proof>
		Since the intersection of subgroups is a subgroup, <m>\bigcap_iS_i</m> is a subgroup of <m>R</m> under addition. Since <m>1\in S_i</m> for every <m>i</m> we get that <m>1\in\bigcap_iS_i</m>. We now show that <m>\bigcap_iS_i</m> is closed under multiplication. If <m>x,y\in\bigcap_iS_i</m> then <m>xy\in S_i</m> for every <m>i</m> because <m>S_i</m> is a subring. Consequently, <m>xy\in\bigcap_iS_i</m>. Hence <m>\bigcap_iS_i</m> is a subring.
	</proof>
	<definition xml:id="def-subring-generated-by">
		<title>(Subring generated by a subset)</title>
		<statement>
			A <term>subring generated by a nonempty subset <m>X</m></term> of a ring <m>R</m> is the intersection of all subrings of <m>R</m> which contain <m>X</m>.

		<statement>
			Let <m>R</m> be a ring. A nonempty subset <m>I</m> of <m>R</m> is said to be a <term>left ideal</term> (resp., a <term>right ideal</term>) of <m>R</m> if <m>(I,+)</m> is a subgroup of <m>(R,+)</m>, and for every <m>r\in R</m> and every <m>x\in I</m> we have <m>rx\in I</m> (resp., <m>xr\in I</m>).
		</statement>
	</definition>
	<definition xml:id="def-ideal">
		<title>(Ideal)</title>
		<statement>
			A nonempty subset <m>I</m> of a ring <m>R</m> is said to be an <term>ideal</term> of <m>R</m> or a <term>two-sided ideal</term> of <m>R</m> if <m>I</m> is both a left and a right ideal of <m>R</m>. Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal if <m>(I,+)</m> is a subgroup of <m>(R,+)</m> and for every <m>r,s\in R</m> and every <m>x\in I</m> we have <m>rxs\in I</m>.

		<title>(Proper ideal)</title>

			</p>
			<p>
				In other words, a left ideal (resp., right ideal or two-sided ideal) <m>I\neq R</m> is maximal if only left ideal (resp., right ideal or two-sided ideal) of <m>R</m> containing <m>I</m> are <m>I</m> and <m>R</m>.
