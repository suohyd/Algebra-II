		<statement>
			Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>f,g\in F[X]</m> be nonzero polynomials. Suppose that <m>f\mid g</m> and <m>g\mid f</m>. Thus there exists <m>h_1,h_2\in F[X]</m> such that <m>g=fh_1</m> and <m>f=gh_2</m>. Therefore, <m>f=fh_1h_2</m>, i.e., <m>f(1-h_1h_2)=0\in F[X]</m>. As <m>F[X]</m> is an integral domain and <m>f\neq 0</m>, we have <m>h_1h_2=1</m>, i.e., <m>h_1,h_2</m> are units in <m>F[X]</m>. Hence, <m>h_1,h_2</m> are constant polynomials.

	<statement>

			Let <m>F</m> be a field. Every ideal <m>I</m> of <m>F[X]</m> is generated by a single element.
		</statement>
	</theorem>
	<proof>
		We assume that <m>I</m> is a nonzero ideal. Let <m>f\in I</m> be a nonzero element of least degree among all elements of <m>I</m>. We claim that <m>I=(f)</m>. Let <m>h\in I</m>. We apply <xref ref="division-algorithm-for-LC-unit"/> to get <m>q,r\in F[X]</m> with <m>\deg(r)\lt\deg(f)</m> such that <m>h=qf+r</m>. Now if <m>r\neq 0</m> then we get that <m>r=h-qf\in I</m>.

	<proof>
		Let <m>f\in F[X]</m> be an irreducible polynomial. Suppose that <m>I</m> is an ideal containing <m>(f)</m>. By <xref ref="polynomial-ring-is-PID"/>, there exists <m>A\in F[X]</m> such that <m>I=(A)</m>. Since <m>f\in I</m> we have <m>A\mid f</m>.

	<theorem xml:id="polynomial-ring-is-UFD">
		<title>(Unique factorization in polynomial ring in one variable over a field)</title>
		<statement>
			Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>F[X]</m> be the polynomial ring over <m>F</m> in one variable. Then every non-constant polynomial <m>f\in F[X]</m> can be written as a product of finite number of irreducible polynomials <m>p_i\in F[X]</m>, i.e., <me>f=p_1p_2\cdots p_n\quad\text{where}\;p_i\;\text{are not necessarily distinct}.</me>
	Furthermore, the above expression is unique up to associates, i.e., if <m>f=q_1q_2\cdots q_m</m> an another factorization of <m>f</m> into irreducibles then <m>m=n</m> and there is some renumbering of <m>p_i</m> so that <m>p_i</m> associate of <m>q_i</m>.
		</statement>
	</theorem>
	<proof>
		If <m>f</m> is irreducible then we are done. So, assume that <m>f</m> is reducible. Let <m>f=f_1f_2</m> be a factorization of <m>f</m> and neither <m>f_i</m> is a constant polynomial. If both <m>f_i</m> are irreducible polynomials we are done. Now assume that one of the polynomials, say <m>f_1</m> is reducible. So, there are <m>f_{1i}\in F[X]</m>, not both constant, such that <m>f_1=f_{11}f_{12}</m>. Say <m>f_{11}</m> is reducible. Then we continue the process. We claim that this process will eventually terminate. Suppose not. Then we get the following infinite chain of ideals:
	<me>I_0=(f)\subsetneq I_1=(f_1)\subsetneq I_2=(f_{11})\subsetneq\cdots\subsetneq F[X]</me>
	Since <m>f_2</m> is not a constant polynomial the first inclusion is strict. Similar reasoning implies that all inclusion are strict. Consider the ideal <m>I=\cup_{i=0}^{\infty} I_i</m>. Since every ideal of <m>F[X]</m> is generated by a single element, there is <m>g\in F[X]</m> with <m>(g)=I</m>. Therefore, there is <m>n</m> such that <m>g\in I_n</m>. Hence, <m>(g)=I\subseteq I_n\subseteq I</m>, i.e., <m>I_n=I_{k}</m> for any <m>k\geq n</m>. Thus this shows that every non-constant polynomial is a product of irreducible factors.
	
	Now assume that <me>f=p_1p_2\cdots p_n=q_1q_2\cdots q_m\quad\text{with}\;n\leq m</me> Since <m>p_1</m> is irreducible it divides <m>q_i</m> for some <m>i</m>. By renumbering we assume that <m>p_1</m> divides <m>q_1</m>. As <m>q_1</m> is irreducible there is <m>u_1\in F^\times</m> such that <m>u_1p_1=q_1</m>. Therefore, we have the following.
	<me>f=p_1p_2\cdots p_n=u_1p_1q_2\cdots q_m</me>
	Thus <m>p_1(p_2\cdots p_n-u_1q_2\cdots q_m)=0</m>. Therefore, as <m>F[X]</m> is an integral domain, <m>p_2p_3\cdots p_n=q_2q_3\cdots q_m</m>. We repeat the above argument to get <m>1=u_1u_2\cdots u_nq_{n+1}\cdots q_m</m>, i.e., <m>q_{n+1},\ldots,q_m</m> are units in <m>F[X]</m>. Hence, <m>q_{n+1},\ldots,q_m</m> are constant polynomials. Therefore, <m>m=n</m> and the last statement of the theorem is proved.

	<proposition xml:id="prime-iff-irreducible-polynomials">
		<statement>
			An ideal <m>I</m> in <m>F[X]</m> is a prime ideal if and only if it is generated by an irreducible polynomial.

	</proposition>
	<proof>
		<p>
			By <xref ref="polynomial-ring-is-PID"/>, there exists <m>f\in F[X]</m> be such that <m>I=(f)</m>.
		</p>
			<p> Suppose that <m>I</m> is a nonzero prime ideal. Let <m>g,h\in F[X]</m> be such that <m>f=gh</m>. Hence <m>gh\in I</m>. Since <m>I</m> is a prime ideal, either <m>g\in I</m> or <m>h\in I</m>. If <m>g\in I</m> then, using <xref ref="divides-each-other-then-differ-by-units-polynomials"/>, we get that <m>g=uf</m> for some unit <m>u</m>. Similar arguments shows that if <m>h\in I</m> then <m>h=u^\prime f</m> for some unit <m>u^\prime</m>. Hence, <m>f</m> is irreducible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conversely, assume that <m>f</m> is irreducible. If <m>gh\in (f)</m> then <m>gh=fk</m> for some <m>k\in F[X]</m>. By the <xref ref="polynomial-ring-is-UFD"/>, either <m>g</m> or <m>h</m> has <m>f</m> as one of the irreducible factors. Hence, either <m>g\in(f)</m> or<m>h\in(f)</m>.

		</statement>
	</proposition>
	<proof>
		By <xref ref="polynomial-ring-is-PID"/>, every ideal of <m>F[X]</m> is principal. Therefore, we can assume that <m>I+J</m> and <m>I\cap J</m> are principal.
		<p>
			We first show that <m>I+J</m> is generated by <m>d=\gcd(f,g)</m>. Since <m>(d)=I+J</m>, we have <m>d\mid f</m> and <m>d\mid g</m>.
